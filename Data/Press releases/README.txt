Earnings press releases retreived from SEC Edgar.


Each text file contains the press release text (stripped from HTML tags and common English stop words). File names follow the PERMNO_YYYYMMDD_X.txt format where PERMNO is the CRSP identifier, YYYYMMDD is the earnings date and X is an internal identifier we used to deal with multiple quarterly report appendices.
